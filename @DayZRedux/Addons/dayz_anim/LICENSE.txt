-----Preface-----
Since the DayZ Community as a whole has decided that common courtesy is optional,
I've decided that having to be explicit with things like licenses is required on my part.
To date, not a single person has asked for permission... yet nearly half a dozen
projects (that I know about) have lifted code from the project.

People don't seem to grasp the concept of asking authors' permissions before using
their works, and this is a rampant problem in the DayZ community at large -- not just as
it relates to Redux.

Ignorance is no longer an excuse, as I am now forced to write an explicit terms of use.

-----Terms of Use-----
The terms of use/license below pertains to all code, artwork, and other assets that have
been created/developed for DayZ Redux.  In short, all assets which are explicit to DayZ
Redux itself and otherwise not withstanding a prior author/owner (e.g. Bohemia
Interactive, Dean "Rocket" Hall, etc.).

Henceforth, mention of 'DayZ Redux' covers the aforementioned assets in their entirety.

Accessing and/or using 'DayZ Redux' assets requires agreement with the following terms
of use/license:

'DayZ Redux' may NOT be modified, included in other mods in whole or part, or used for
any commercial purposes whatsoever without prior permission from the authors ('Venthos'
and 'Alexander').

Redistribution of the addon is not permitted without prior permission from the authors.
Modifications are forbidden without prior permission from the authors. Operating a
server with these assets, whether unmodified or modified, is not permitted without
prior permission from the authors.
